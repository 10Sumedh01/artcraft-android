# The soft keyboard's return after the user dismissed it — the app-side patch.
#
# Android takes the back key as "hide the keyboard" and tells the app nothing about it: the
# app goes on believing the keyboard is up, so it never asks for it again, and the keyboard
# stays down through the rest of the session — the next edit (a tap in the text, a caret moved
# by key) goes unseen by it. The keyboard only came back with a restart.
#
# Two things are needed for it to come back, and neither is in the app's own code:
#
#  * the Activity has to *know* the keyboard was dismissed. It watches the keyboard's own
#    window insets: a keyboard that was on and then went away while the app still wanted it
#    was dismissed by the user;
#  * the shell has to *report* that the document is being worked on again. It sees the edits
#    (a pointer press, a key that is not the back key) and tells the Activity, which then
#    asks for the keyboard again.
#
# Only WordCraft gets this: the other apps keep the keyboard where the app puts it.
#
# Every edit is guarded and idempotent: it applies only while the original text is still
# present, so it no-ops once the code is there, and it is re-applied on a fresh checkout.
#
# To test WITHOUT the patch, comment out the call to this script in lib/build-common.sh.
#
# Usage: ime.sh <source-dir> <app> <title>

# stop at the paragraph's ends, and when there is nothing to the left it returns without touching the
# document. At the start of a paragraph the one character before the caret is the paragraph mark,
# which has no characters of its own — so Backspace did nothing there, and two paragraphs could never
# be joined: on a phone, once Enter was pressed there was no way to take the line break back.
#
# On a desktop the same key arrives as `Key::Backspace` and the `text.backspace` command joins the
# paragraphs (and, at the start of a list item, removes the number or the indent first, as Word does).
# So when the input method asks to erase exactly one character before a caret that is already at the
# start of the paragraph, run that same command. Only that case: a larger count means a correction
# whose text really does start at the paragraph start, and must not join paragraphs.
